**Step 3: Define the countries or territories that you want to compare.** Add countries by simply typing their name in the respective box. When you start typing, a list will appear that will help you find the country you wanted. Just click on the name and it will be added to the list.  If you want to remove a country, just click on it and press the DELETE key.   

**That's it! You can see the results now.** You dont need to do anything else. The application automatically refreshes the results when you change any input. The comparison reports of Export & Import values by country will appear in the right pane.
